Test Generation for Voter Transaction Logs and Voter Records

<<Executables>>

genVTlogs.rb : generates voter records and voter transaction logs (VTLs), for
               N=10 voters by default.  Writes files to the VTlogs/ directory.
               If one argument is provided, it is used for N. If an additional
               argument is provided, it is used as the voter registration
               deadline. 

vtl_xml_validate.rb : takes one or two arguments, a VTL file name and an
                      optional VTL schema file name, and validates the file
                      against the schema.  The file ../public/schemas/VTL.xsd
                      holds the official VTL schema, which is used when the
                      2nd argument isnot provided.
